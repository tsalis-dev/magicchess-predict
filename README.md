## üìú About The Project

This project was born out of research and curiosity about the matchmaking algorithm in Magic Chess. After recording and analyzing several games, it was discovered that the opponent matching system is **not entirely random**, but rather follows a complex, predictive pattern.

This tool is an implementation of the **"Anchor Player" Theory**, which allows players to know who their opponents will be in several upcoming matches by recording information from the initial rounds. The goal is to provide a strategic advantage, enabling players to better manage their positioning and preparations.

## üß† The "Anchor Player" Theory Explained

The prediction logic behind this tool is based on the first two opponents you face. They become "Anchors" for subsequent predictions.

1.  **Anchor 1 (A1):** Is the opponent you face in **Match 1**.
2.  **Anchor 2 (A2):** Is the opponent you face in **Match 2**.
3.  **Opponent Predictions:**
    - **Match 3:** You will face the player who was **A1's** opponent in Match 2.
    - **Match 5:** You will face the player who was **A1's** opponent in Match 4.
    - **Match 6:** You will face the player who was **A2's** opponent in Match 5.
    - **Match 7:** You will face the player who was **A1's** opponent in Match 6.
